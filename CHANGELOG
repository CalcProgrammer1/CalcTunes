Version 0.42 Alpha (5/28/2012)
	- Fixed screen rotation being broken in 0.41 Alpha update
	
Version 0.41 Alpha (5/2/2012)
	- Implemented a full backend service for playback content management.  This service takes a library cursor or filesystem
	file from the view handler that is now responsible for the main ListView.  The playback service then opens a MediaPlayer
	Handler to play the files and handles media callbacks to increment to the next track.  It provides a callback interface
	for media information updates which is used to set the information TextViews and Album Art View when media playback info
	changes.  The Seekbar handler was updated to support this new playback service.
	- Implemented an exit and minimize function.  The exit function terminates the playback service and closes everything,
	while the minimize function only closes the Activity, leaving the playback service active to keep playing music.  The
	service is reconnected when the Activity is opened again, and the Now Playing bar automatically fills in with the Now
	Playing track data from the Service, resuming control over the playback.
	
Version 0.40 Alpha (4/29/2012)
	- Beginning to implement a background service to handle audio playback.  The system now uses a Service to run the audio
	backend, but the current library state tracking is done in the main Activity still.  This functionality needs to be
	moved into the Service as well to make the system retain its state after the UI is closed and playback is continuing
	in the background.  The "Add Library" button in the menu works now as well.

Version 0.39 Alpha (2/28/2012)
	- Disabled default title bar, started work on a new custom title/menu bar that will have icons and replace the context
	menu for Android 3.0+ devices.  2.x devices will still have the context menu but will also have the new menu bar.
	
Version 0.38 Alpha (2/26/2012)
	- Fixed seeking from end to beginning/beginning to end
	
Version 0.37 Alpha (2/11/2012)
	- Fixed Last.Fm album art scanner

Version 0.36 Alpha (1/14/2012)
	- Added new color scheme for Seek Bar

Version 0.35 Alpha (1/14/2012)
	- Fixed file browser crash on no permissions and IO error directories
	- Now playing file is now highlighted across libraries and filesystem views
	- Reorganized sources list, put filesystem under "System" heading
	- Edited main.c from AndLess to use CalcTunes directory for libraries, fixes bug where AndLess app required
	- No longer crashes when rescanning, editing, or deleting a library 
	
Version 0.34 Alpha (1/12/2012)
Filesystem browser is implemented but is not feature-complete and needs work.  It can do basic browsing and play media files,
but there is no filtering or sanity checking on permissions.  Also did some tweaking to mediaplayer and interface to fix bugs.

Version 0.33 Alpha (1/11/2012)
LibraryDatabaseAdapter has been completely redone yet again, this time back to a BaseAdapter backed by not one but THREE
different Cursors.  The first cursor holds the first N entries and the other two jump around the dataset.  This improves
performance on large datasets (my FLAC library is ~9000 songs) and prevents Application Not Responding messages.

Version 0.32 Alpha (1/10/2012)
More interface tweaks to improve the overall look and feel of the program.  The now playing frame has been reorganized
to more efficiently use the available space and provide room for a time display (not yet implemented).  The control
buttons have been condensed into a square block on the left, and the album art placeholder on the right is now
functional, displaying cached album art when a track is loaded.  New changes have been made to the settings activity
which now uses the PreferenceActivity system to provide a nicer UI.  The Android API Demos Color Picker is now available
to select the interface color.  More integration with SharedPreferences which will allow more persistent settings.

Version 0.31 Alpha (1/10/2012)
Updated content list design to include album art and a nicer looking album header.  Artist headers are now shaded for
visual contrast.  Spacing modified to make the interface feel less cramped.  Dividing lines on content list are now
invisible, making it look cleaner and making album grouping more prominent.  Preliminary Last.FM support which should
eventually provide a source for album art, scrobbling of played songs, and maybe even artist/album information.

Version 0.30 Alpha (1/6/2012)
AndLess lossless library integration complete.  Playback, next/prev, seekbar, stopping, and song finished callbacks are all
implemented and tested.  It should be virtually indistinguishable between MediaPlayer and liblossless playback, allowing
CalcTunes to support additional codecs on additional devices.  Tested with HP Touchpad CM7 which lacks native FLAC playback.

Version 0.29 Alpha (1/5/2012)
More work on AndLess native lossless integration, there is now basic seek functionality and it doesn't crash as easily
as it did before.  Now it needs a callback interface to let the mediaplayer handler know when the track has finished.

Version 0.28 Alpha (1/4/2012)
Added some native code from the AndLess project to provide lossless playback on devices that don't support these codecs
natively.  The interface is still unfinished, as the seek bar doesn't function correctly and it can crash at times.

Version 0.27 Alpha (12/31/2011)
Fixed some bugs with the new ExpandableListView library list, library status now refreshed after library scan is complete.

Version 0.26 Alpha (12/24/2011)
Changed source list from ListView to ExpandableListView so that playlists can be grouped separately from libraries.
Settings menu implemented which can adjust color, will add more options as they are needed.

Version 0.25 Alpha (12/21/2011)
Added a clean gradient effect to the source and now playing areas and added some minor fixes to the navigation buttons.

Version 0.24 Alpha (12/21/2011)
Library list adapter replaced with a new CursorAdapter-based adapter that attaches to the library SQL database directly.
This greatly improves loading speed and scrolling efficiency, plus it makes it simplifies previous/next track seeking.
Also implemented with this adapter is current track highlighting, the current track is highlighted in dark gray.

Version 0.23 Alpha (12/20/2011)
Source list now has a custom adapter that handles library status and displays the appropriate icon.  The callback needs
to be modified to display warnings should the user select an unavailable or offline/partially offline library, possibly
giving the option to re-scan or delete the library.

Version 0.22 Alpha (12/20/2011)
Library scanner now runs asynchronously and displays a notification showing scan progress.  Other libraries may still be
used while scanning.  Added the beginnings of a library status system which will detect offline, unavailable, and updating
libraries and restrict access/force updates to ones that do not have a database built.

Version 0.21 Alpha (12/19/2011)
Added preliminary support for SQLite database system.  The library data is now stored in a SQLite database and the library data
is populated from this database.  This is the beginning of a library data caching system that should improve loading performance
especially for network-based libraries.  It already shows a decent speed boost on a small local library.

Version 0.20 Alpha (12/17/2011)
Cleaned up the main activity code to get the lengthy callback routines out of onCreate.  Created a context menu for editing
and deleting libraries.  Restructured the library passing system and library filename routines.  Sidebar now stays hidden
during rotation.

Version 0.19 Alpha (12/16/2011)
Media library now sorted alphabetically for artists and albums, sorted by track number for songs.  Added an option to show
and hide the sidebar.  Preliminary support for hardware media buttons (such as Bluetooth headsets, car systems, etc) - works
when application is open but does not yet work during background play.

Version 0.18 Alpha (12/16/2011)
Simple previous/next track functionality implemented and working.  Next song plays when current song finishes.  When playback
reaches either end of library, next returns last and prev returns first track of library.  Prev and Next buttons are functional.
When playback is stopped, media information text is cleared.

Version 0.17 Alpha (12/16/2011)
Changed the way I access the jAudioTagger library.  There is a problem using the generic AudioFile class on read-only MP3
files.  This does not appear to affect FLAC or other formats though, so if a read-only MP3 is detected, I initialize it
using a special MP3-only constructor to properly read it.  I also fixed a permissions bug that prevented the application
from being useful on most all Android devices (did not have file permissions, yet my A43 still allowed it to run???!)

Version 0.16 Alpha (12/14/2011)
Replaced ugly text buttons with new icon buttons for play/next/prev/stop controls.  Also added a placeholder for album art
and replaced the stock Android icon with a placeholder CalcTunes icon (vinyl record).

Version 0.15 Alpha (12/13/2011)
Rewrote the media player interface through a new class MediaPlayerHandler.  This performs sanity checking on all media
player actions to make sure that nothing is called in the wrong state.  It also provides a wrapper for releasing media
player resources (Stop) and pausing playback.  It uses asynchronous calls when possible to increase efficiency.
The sources list now redraws properly when the screen is rotated as well.

Version 0.14 Alpha (12/13/2011)
Added fields for track number and duration to song's list view.  Time is computed from seconds into MM:SS format and displayed
to the right while track number is printed to the left of the song.  There is no sorting function yet, so songs, albums,
and track numbers are displayed in meaningless order.

Version 0.13 Alpha (12/13/2011)
Replaced the main list's adapter with a custom adapter.  This allows for much more customization of the library list,
hopefully allowing things like album artwork and additional information fields to be displayed in the future.

Version 0.12 Alpha (12/13/2011)
Cleaned up the interface backend code, instead of cramming it all into one class I created handler classes for the two main
lists and for the seek bar.  This cleans up threading and makes the code more modular.

Version 0.11 Alpha (12/13/2011)
Added an Options Menu that moves the Add Library button off of the main screen to save space.  An exit button is partially
implemented and a settings button is in place.

Version 0.1 Alpha (12/13/2011)
This is the first commit.  The program compiles and runs (Tested on Archos 43, OpenAOS CM7).  Libraries can be built and
a basic scanning system is in place.  The media player can play and stop but not seek tracks yet.
