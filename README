CalcTunes - An iTunes-ish Media Player For Android

CalcTunes (working title) is a new media player for Android that is mainly targeted at tablets.  While many media players
exist for phones and handhelds, most of these do not take advantage of the screen space provided by a larger tablet.
To more efficiently use the space, I am creating a two-panel layout similar to iTunes, Songbird, Clementine, and other
desktop media player applications.  On the left will be media sources (Libraries and Playlists).  The right (larger)
panel is where media files will be listed (grouped by artist/album).

Libraries
---------
The problem I have with Android's stock media player is the stupid auto-media-scan thing.  It scans only where it feels
like scanning and you can't access any media that it doesn't find.  This sucks, because a lot of people have media
stored in places not in /mnt/sdcard and would still like to use it.  Android's built in library will not accept this and
the stock music player won't play these files.

To solve this problem, other developers (such as MortPlayer, a great improvement over the stock player) have created
customized library systems.  MortPlayer revolves around selecting a "master" root folder which is scanned for media.
While this is a lot better than the stock player, my complaint is that there can only be one "master" folder, still
limiting you to one source at a time.

CalcTunes will remedy this problem by allowing any number of user-defined libraries, and also these libraries can contain
more than just one "master" folder.  For instance, one library named "My FLAC" could contain both /mnt/storage/FLAC and
/mnt/sdcard/FLAC and possibly even /mnt/networkdrive/FLAC.  The plan is to build library data from these folders by
scanning the tags from the audio files, then caching this tag data locally so that you don't have to wait around for long
media rescans, especially on network drives.

Playlists
---------
In addition to libraries, CalcTunes will support playlists.  These will likely be stored in a standard playlist format and
will be created through the CalcTunes application.  They don't need a master folder, they just list tracks directly. I am
not sure whether or not playlists will be cached or not.

Current Status - Version 0.20 Alpha (12/17/2011)
--------------
Cleaned up the main activity code to get the lengthy callback routines out of onCreate.  Created a context menu for editing
and deleting libraries.  Restructured the library passing system and library filename routines.  Sidebar now stays hidden
during rotation.

Release History
---------------
Version 0.19 Alpha (12/16/2011)
Media library now sorted alphabetically for artists and albums, sorted by track number for songs.  Added an option to show
and hide the sidebar.  Preliminary support for hardware media buttons (such as Bluetooth headsets, car systems, etc) - works
when application is open but does not yet work during background play.

Version 0.18 Alpha (12/16/2011)
Simple previous/next track functionality implemented and working.  Next song plays when current song finishes.  When playback
reaches either end of library, next returns last and prev returns first track of library.  Prev and Next buttons are functional.
When playback is stopped, media information text is cleared.

Version 0.17 Alpha (12/16/2011)
Changed the way I access the jAudioTagger library.  There is a problem using the generic AudioFile class on read-only MP3
files.  This does not appear to affect FLAC or other formats though, so if a read-only MP3 is detected, I initialize it
using a special MP3-only constructor to properly read it.  I also fixed a permissions bug that prevented the application
from being useful on most all Android devices (did not have file permissions, yet my A43 still allowed it to run???!)

Version 0.16 Alpha (12/14/2011)
Replaced ugly text buttons with new icon buttons for play/next/prev/stop controls.  Also added a placeholder for album art
and replaced the stock Android icon with a placeholder CalcTunes icon (vinyl record).

Version 0.15 Alpha (12/13/2011)
Rewrote the media player interface through a new class MediaPlayerHandler.  This performs sanity checking on all media
player actions to make sure that nothing is called in the wrong state.  It also provides a wrapper for releasing media
player resources (Stop) and pausing playback.  It uses asynchronous calls when possible to increase efficiency.
The sources list now redraws properly when the screen is rotated as well.

Version 0.14 Alpha (12/13/2011)
Added fields for track number and duration to song's list view.  Time is computed from seconds into MM:SS format and displayed
to the right while track number is printed to the left of the song.  There is no sorting function yet, so songs, albums,
and track numbers are displayed in meaningless order.

Version 0.13 Alpha (12/13/2011)
Replaced the main list's adapter with a custom adapter.  This allows for much more customization of the library list,
hopefully allowing things like album artwork and additional information fields to be displayed in the future.

Version 0.12 Alpha (12/13/2011)
Cleaned up the interface backend code, instead of cramming it all into one class I created handler classes for the two main
lists and for the seek bar.  This cleans up threading and makes the code more modular.

Version 0.11 Alpha (12/13/2011)
Added an Options Menu that moves the Add Library button off of the main screen to save space.  An exit button is partially
implemented and a settings button is in place.

Version 0.1 Alpha (12/13/2011)
This is the first commit.  The program compiles and runs (Tested on Archos 43, OpenAOS CM7).  Libraries can be built and
a basic scanning system is in place.  The media player can play and stop but not seek tracks yet.
