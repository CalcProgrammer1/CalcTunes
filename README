CalcTunes - An iTunes-ish Media Player For Android

CalcTunes (working title) is a new media player for Android that is mainly targeted at tablets.  While many media players
exist for phones and handhelds, most of these do not take advantage of the screen space provided by a larger tablet.
To more efficiently use the space, I am creating a two-panel layout similar to iTunes, Songbird, Clementine, and other
desktop media player applications.  On the left will be media sources (Libraries and Playlists).  The right (larger)
panel is where media files will be listed (grouped by artist/album).

Libraries
---------
The problem I have with Android's stock media player is the stupid auto-media-scan thing.  It scans only where it feels
like scanning and you can't access any media that it doesn't find.  This sucks, because a lot of people have media
stored in places not in /mnt/sdcard and would still like to use it.  Android's built in library will not accept this and
the stock music player won't play these files.

To solve this problem, other developers (such as MortPlayer, a great improvement over the stock player) have created
customized library systems.  MortPlayer revolves around selecting a "master" root folder which is scanned for media.
While this is a lot better than the stock player, my complaint is that there can only be one "master" folder, still
limiting you to one source at a time.

CalcTunes will remedy this problem by allowing any number of user-defined libraries, and also these libraries can contain
more than just one "master" folder.  For instance, one library named "My FLAC" could contain both /mnt/storage/FLAC and
/mnt/sdcard/FLAC and possibly even /mnt/networkdrive/FLAC.  The plan is to build library data from these folders by
scanning the tags from the audio files, then caching this tag data locally so that you don't have to wait around for long
media rescans, especially on network drives.

Playlists
---------
In addition to libraries, CalcTunes will support playlists.  These will likely be stored in a standard playlist format and
will be created through the CalcTunes application.  They don't need a master folder, they just list tracks directly. I am
not sure whether or not playlists will be cached or not.
